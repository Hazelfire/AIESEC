# RIP Nanolink
This repo is dedicated to a team for a hackathon that was run by AIESEC that had no coding
involved. 

The team consisted of
- De Xing Teoh
- Sam Nolan
- Brandon Lee
- Michael Smith
- Bryce George

The team found it's end in a tragic accident where AIESEC falsly advertised
their business competition as a hackathon. 

Two bottles of iced tea, 2 slabs of red bull, and $25 were lossed in the event.
